# Initialise the project

Runs once, right after cloning the boilerplate.

Start from a clean `git status`. If the tree is dirty, stop and ask the user to
commit or stash first.

## 1. Ask for the name

Use `AskUserQuestion`: "What should this project be called?" Offer the repo
directory's basename as the first option; the user can type another via "Other".

The name must be a valid Cloudflare Worker name: lowercase letters, digits and
hyphens. If the answer is not (`My App`, `my_app`), convert it to kebab-case
(`my-app`) and confirm the converted name with the user before going on.

Done when you hold one confirmed kebab-case name.

## 2. Rename

Invoke the `rename-project` skill with the name and follow it through, including
its commit. Its "still mentions the old name" list includes hits inside
`.claude/skills/`; leave those as they are.

Done when `git status` is clean and the commit names both the old and new name.
`remove-clerk` needs that clean tree to start.

## 3. Ask about auth

Use `AskUserQuestion`: "Keep Clerk authentication?"

- **Keep Clerk**: invoke the `setup-clerk` skill and follow it through. It
  picks or creates the Clerk application and puts its keys in
  `apps/web/.env.local`.
- **Remove Clerk**: invoke the `remove-clerk` skill and follow it through,
  including its verification.

Done when the chosen branch is complete.

## 4. Put the name in the README

`rename-project` already set the `# ` heading of `README.md` to the display name
(`my-app` -> `My App`). Make the intro sentence under it name the project too:

```markdown
# My App

`my-app` is a [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com) monorepo, managed with Bun workspaces.
```

Read the whole `README.md` afterwards. Done when it names the project and no
line still calls it the boilerplate.

## 5. Cloudflare

Invoke the `setup-cloudflare` skill and follow it through. It signs the user
in, records the account, and asks before it creates the D1 database and
deploys. This comes last so the deploy ships the renamed, Clerk-decided app.

Done when the skill has handed back, whether or not the user chose to deploy.

## 6. Hand back

Report the name, whether Clerk was kept (and which Clerk app), the Worker URL
or that the deploy was skipped, and the uncommitted diff from steps 3 to 5.
Commit only if the user asks. Pass on the follow-ups the invoked skills raised
(an old deployed Worker, the D1 `database_id` in `wrangler.jsonc`, a Clerk
production instance, Clerk secrets or the dashboard app after a removal); leave
those to the user.
